# Background Work Example

This project is an Android application that provides example code for background execution tasks in Android.

## Purpose

The **Background Work Example** app demonstrates how to implement various background execution techniques in Android. It covers different components and frameworks that allow apps to perform tasks outside the main thread, ensuring smooth user experiences while handling background operations.

## Features

The project includes examples related to the following Android background execution mechanisms:

- **Service**: Demonstrates how to use Android's `Service` component for long-running background tasks.
- **Coroutine**: Shows how to leverage Kotlin's `Coroutines` for efficient background work without blocking the main thread.
- **AIDL**: Contains examples on how to use Android Interface Definition Language (AIDL) to perform IPC (Inter-process Communication) between applications.
- **JobScheduler**: Provides an example of scheduling jobs that can execute in the background, even after an application has been terminated.
- **WorkManager**: Demonstrates how to use `WorkManager` to schedule and manage deferrable, guaranteed background work.

## Status

This project is currently a **work-in-progress**. Some examples are fully implemented, while others are still being developed.
